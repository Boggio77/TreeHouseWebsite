                <h2>T. Corcelles</h2>
                My husband, teenage daughter and I were in town for a wedding near Charleston Treehouse and picked the perfect place to stay for the weekend! From the minute we walked inside, we felt relaxed and at home. Karen was one of the most responsive and helpful hosts we have ever experienced. Her husband Bob was very knowledgeable about the wildlife in the marsh. We enjoyed morning coffee and happy hour beverages from the deck and the view is spectacular! The amenities were top notch and it was an extra bonus that Karen provided drinks, snacks and coffee! We had a great night of sleep on a super comfy mattress. Our teenager said it was the most luxurious place we have ever stayed. We wish we had been able to stay longer and hope that we can stay in the lovely Charleston Treehouse again. Thank you for your excellent hospitality!
